/*
CPP preprocessor is program that sources your program before it starts

looks for preprocesser directive that starts with #


#include <iostream>
When preprocessers sees this directive it replaces with file included
So by the time compiler sees the src code all comments are striped
and all preprocessors are removed.


cpp preprocessor does not understand cpp it simply follows preprocessor directive and
gets src code ready for compiler


#include "myfile.h"

#if
#elif
#else
#endif
